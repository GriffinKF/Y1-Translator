/**
 * The Node class is used to create a node object within our Binary Tree which was the selected data structure by the team to manage the dictionary storage.
 * It contains several variables which hold specific values that are used for word identification.
 * 
 *  left - it is used to connect a following node with smaller comparison ID.
 *  right - it is used to connect a following node with higher comparison ID.
 *  id - an integer value that is unique for each node within the specific tree, used to compare values when balancing and searching in the tree
 *  word_active - the unique word in the list which is being translated, used to create the hash(id) value of the node
 *  word_translated - the translated version of the word in the following language, might not be unique.
 *  found - A boolean value used by the balancing algorithm to define if a node was checked in the file.
 * 
 * @author truth
